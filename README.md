## Wolfram Alpha fallback
General knowledge fallback handler

## Description 
Ask general-knowledge queries of your Mycroft device.  If no other skills can
handle the request, [Wolfram Alpha](https://wolframalpha.com) will be queried
to see if it can find an answer.  You'll be surprised by how much it knows!

For deeper exploration, you can also request the sources behind the answer.
An email will be sent to your registered account linking you to all the
details within Wolfram Alpha's website.

## Examples 
* "How tall is Mount Everest?"
* "When was The Rocky Horror Picture Show released?"
* "What is Madonna's real name?"
* "What's 18 times 4?"
* "How many inches in a meter?"
* "Send me the source on that" (info on the last query)
